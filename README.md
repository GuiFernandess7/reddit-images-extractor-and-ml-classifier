# Reddit User Image Extractor


## Introduction

Reddit User Image Extractor effectively harnesses ELT processes to gather and store user images from the 'amiugly' subreddit. By utilizing the Reddit API, SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Amazon S3, this application provides a foundation for future machine learning and data processing tasks.

One potential application of the collected data is to develop a classification model that predicts the gender of individuals in the images. By training a machine learning algorithm on a labeled dataset, the model could analyze visual features to make accurate predictions about the gender of the person in a given photo. This capability could enhance various applications, such as targeted marketing or user profiling in social media platforms.

Overall, this project not only showcases the integration of various tools and technologies but also highlights the potential for further exploration in image classification and data analysis.
